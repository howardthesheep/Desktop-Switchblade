Parker Jones has had an interest in computer science since he started coding in middle school. Parker participated in and helped found the Computer Council Club of Camdenton High School (Which really means he played video games at school with his friends). Following graduation, Parker attended the University of Missouri Science and Technology. During this time, Parker joined the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program and worked on a project titled "Performance Benchmarks for Efficient Disaster Response using Dynamic Spectrum Access" with graduate student Vijay Shah. Parker is now attending the University of Missouri-Columbia continuing his degree path.</font></p></body></html>
